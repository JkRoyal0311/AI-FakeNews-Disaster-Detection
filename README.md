# AI-Powered Fake News & Misinformation Detection during Climate Disasters

##Problem Statement
During natural disasters like floods and cyclones, fake news and misinformation spread quickly on social media. 
This creates panic, misguides rescue operations, and misuses resources. 
The goal of this project is to build an AI/ML-based system that detects misinformation in disaster-related content.

---

##Objectives
- Collect and preprocess disaster-related text data (tweets/news).
- Build ML & NLP models to classify real vs fake content.
- Deploy a simple demo app for classification.

---

##4-Week Plan
- **Week 1:** Project setup, identify Python libraries, environment setup.
- **Week 2:** Dataset collection & preprocessing, baseline ML models.
- **Week 3:** Advanced NLP/transformer models (BERT/DistilBERT).
- **Week 4:** Deployment (Streamlit app) + Final report/presentation.

---

##Libraries (Planned)
- **Data Handling:** pandas, numpy
- **NLP Preprocessing:** nltk, spacy, re
- **Feature Extraction:** scikit-learn (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer), gensim
- **Deep Learning/Transformers:** torch, transformers (HuggingFace)
- **Evaluation & Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.metrics
- **Deployment:** streamlit

---

##Week 1 Deliverables
- Repo created with README.md
- requirements.txt with core libraries
- Sample notebook (`AI_FakeNews_Detecion`) showing:
  - Import of libraries
  - Text cleaning demo on 2â€“3 sample tweets
